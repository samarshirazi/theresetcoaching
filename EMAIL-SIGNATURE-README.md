After setup:
1. Send a test email to yourself
2. Check that links work (Instagram, website, email, phone)
3. Verify colors display correctly
4. Test on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

**Signature looks broken:** Make sure you copied the HTML from a browser render, not the raw HTML code.

**Images not showing:** The logo is CSS-based, not an image file, so it should display in most email clients.

**Colors are different:** Some email clients modify colors. This is normal and unavoidable.

**Plain text needed:** Use the .txt version for clients that don't support HTML.
