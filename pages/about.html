                    <h2>My Story</h2>
                    <p>For over 25 years, I've lived and breathed real estate. From starting my career in one of the toughest markets, land development, to expanding into luxury homes, investment asset building, and international markets, I've seen every side of this business.</p>

                    <p>I achieved success as a Top Realtor in Toronto. But my path wasn't always smooth. Like many agents, I faced burnout, unpredictable income, and the pressure to fit into the "sales personality" mold that never felt true to who I was.</p>

                    <p>The turning point came when I realized that long-term success in real estate doesn't come from scripts, cold calls, or trying to be someone you're not, it comes from self-leadership, clarity, authenticity, staying true to your values, and aligning your business with your natural strengths.</p>

                    <p>That realization sparked my mission: to help other agents reset their careers and create the business and life they've always wanted.</p>

My coaching blends everything I've learned over 25 years in real estate and 35+ years of multi industry business leadership across two continents, with science backed methods drawn from neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and performance science.</p>

                <p>Through The Reset Coaching, I provide coaching consulting services for real estate agents and professionals who want more than just quick wins, they want:</p>

                <h2>Beyond Real Estate</h2>
                <p>Flora's journey extends far beyond real estate. With over 35 years of international experience, from translation services with the UNDP, to navigating Dubai's dynamic business landscape, to building success in Canada's markets, she understands what it means to face burnout, change directions, and reinvent yourself across multiple life chapters.</p>

                <p>Having personally experienced her own "what's next?" moments as a woman over 40, Flora discovered a crucial truth: you're not broken, burned out, or "too late." The problem isn't you, it's that generic advice often ignores the unique needs and strengths that come with lived experience.</p>

                <p>This perspective is what makes The Reset Coaching different. Flora doesn't offer quick fixes or one size fits all strategies. Instead, she helps clients transform what they've been told are "limitations" into their greatest assets, turning midlife transitions into authentic new chapters of growth.</p>

    <!-- Why I Do This Work -->

            <div class="why-content">
                <h2>Why I Do This Work</h2>
                <p>I know what it feels like to question whether you're cut out for the path you've chosen, in real estate, business, or even life itself. I've been there. I've faced burnout, identity shifts, and the challenge of reinventing myself in different markets and life stages.</p>

                <p>That's why my coaching is both personal and practical. It's not about forcing you into someone else's mold, it's about helping you recognize that your so-called weaknesses are often your greatest strengths. Whether you're an agent striving for consistent success or a woman navigating a new chapter, my mission is to help you reset, reclaim your confidence, and design a future that truly fits who you are.</p>

                        <p>When I'm not coaching, you'll find me exploring new hiking trails, reading the latest research in neuroscience and psychology, or spending quality time with my family.
